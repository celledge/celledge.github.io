I plan to write several articles on the core concepts of firmware
development and move into more advanced topics. For the simple
concepts I will probably be mostly referring to AVR processors due to
Atmel's freely available toolchain and their common use in Arduino
designs. As I move into the more advanced concepts I will probably
move on to other processors including various ARM processors.

### Planned Core Concepts
* Micro-controller Architectures
* Assembly and C Compilers
* Registers
* Common Peripherals
* Interrupts

### Planned Advanced Topics
* Direct Memory Access
* Asynchronous Programming
* Real Time Operating Systems
* Power Management
* Fixed Point Math

There are plenty of other resources for getting started with
micro-controller programming for all kinds of chips, so I plan to skip
any kind of introduction to coding in C and examples on getting
started with a particular micro-controller. Instead I will mainly be
going into the theory of operation on these topics in the hope that
with that knowledge it will be easier to take the examples available
in the wild and tame them to your needs. The intended audience is
expected to have a software engineering background.
